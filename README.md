# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices. The goal of this project is to estimate the prices of houses based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, age, and others.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks containing the exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
- **feature_description.txt**: Description of the features in the dataset.
- **README.md**: Project overview, instructions, and documentation.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing: Analyzed the dataset to understand the distributions, relationships between features, and handle missing values and outliers.
- Model Selection and Training: Trained multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
- Predictions: Used the best-performing model to make predictions on new or unseen data and answer specific questions about house prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
- scikit-learn: Machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development and documentation.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the project workflow and findings.
4. Run the notebooks locally to reproduce the analysis and results.
